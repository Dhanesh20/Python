    "If-else is a control flow statement used in computer programming that allows the execution of different blocks of code depending on whether a certain condition is true or false.

If the condition is true, the code within the corresponding block of curly braces is executed. If the condition is false, the code within the \"else\" block is executed. The \"else\" block is optional and is executed only if the condition in the \"if\" statement is false. The syntax for if-else statement in most programming languages is as follows:\n",

    "#### **Limitations of loops**\n",
    "\n",
    "The limitations of loops in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Infinite loops: If the condition used in a while loop never becomes false, the loop will continue running indefinitely, potentially causing the program to crash or freeze. This can happen if the condition is not properly defined or if there is a logic error in the loop body.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Execution time: Loops can be time-consuming, especially if they are processing large amounts of data or running many iterations. This can slow down the program's overall execution time and make it less efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Limited flexibility: Loops are best suited for tasks that involve repeating the same operation multiple times. However, some problems require more complex logic that may not be easily expressed using loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Code readability: Loops can make code more difficult to read and understand, especially if they are nested or contain complex conditionals. This can make it harder to debug and maintain the code over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Complexity: As the number of loops and nested loops increases, the complexity of the code increases as well. This can make the code harder to understand and debug, especially for novice programmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to use loops judiciously and consider alternative approaches (such as list comprehensions or recursion) when appropriate to avoid these limitations.\n"
